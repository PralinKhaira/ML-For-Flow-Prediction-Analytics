Project 11: Multi-stage continuous-flow manufacturing process
Real process data to predict factory output

Context
This data was taken from an actual production run spanning several hours. The goal is to predict certain properties of the line's output from the various input data. The line is a high-speed, continuous manufacturing process with parallel and series stages.

Expected submission
We are always looking for the best predictive modeling approaches to use in real time production environments. Models are employed for several use cases such as development of real time process controllers (use the models in simulation environments) and anomaly detection (compare model predictions to actual outputs in real time).

Dataset
The data comes from a continuous flow manufacturing process with multiple stages. Sample rates are 1 Hz.
•	In the first stage, Machines 1, 2, and 3 operate in parallel, and feed their outputs into a step that combines the flows.
•	Output from the combiner is measured in 15 locations. These measurements are the primary measurements to predict.
•	Next, the output flows into a second stage, where Machines 4 and 5 process in series.
•	Measurements are made again in the same 15 locations. These are the secondary measurements to predict.
